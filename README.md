# Amazon-Review-Sorting

The scoring system of a product and the order of the reviews are displayed to the users are very effective factors in the decision process of the user. For this reason, instead of a score calculated with a simple average, the timing of the scoring, the characteristics of the user who made the scoring, etc. Many parameters need to be evaluated separately.

In this project it is aimed to calculate the score and listing the reviews of the most reviewed product in the electronics category on Amazon.
